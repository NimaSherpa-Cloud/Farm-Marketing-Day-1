		<p><strong>Farm Marketing Solutions</strong> is a resource for farmers looking to start or build their farm business.</p>
		<p>As farmers, a lot of us are really good at raising chickens, growing vegetables, or herding cattle, but not all of us are great at business and marketing. Me personally, if I could just raise my crops and give them away and still live a good life I would. But I cannot. I must make money doing what I love.</p>
		<p>	Perhaps you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Are looking to start a farm but don't know where to begin.</li>
			<li>Are 1-3 years into running your farm and you really need to make the business viable.</li>
			<li>Or you have been farming for years and you are looking to expand your farm business or bring it to the next level.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Regardless of where you are on your journey <strong>Farm Marketing Solutions</strong> will prove to be a valuable resource for you. I share all of my successes and failures running my farm. I have compiled the resources that I have used through the years to get where I am. I even created some that did not exist anywhere else.</p>
